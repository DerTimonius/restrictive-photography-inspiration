        As photographers we sometimes can get stuck in a rut. <br /> We feel
        uninspired, we can't see a great shot anywhere, no matter where we look
        or how hard we try.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Restriction breeds inspiration!</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        By restricting ourselves we force our creative mind to think in ways it
        normally does not have to. I'll give you an example: When using a zoom
        lens, if there's something at the edge of the frame you don't want to
        include in your final image, you just zoom in and out until it's gone.{' '}
        <br />
        But when using a prime lens, you physically have to move! And since
        you're forced to move to a different spot, maybe the composition changes
        and you have to think about it more thoroughly.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        So, get inspired by limiting your subjects, your usage of lenses or use
        different gimmicks!
