# Restrictive Photography Inspiration

Get inspired by restriction your options for taking photographs.

This application randomly chooses from a pre-made list of
restrictions that will help you get inspired. If you have any other
ideas for restrictions, feel free to contact me!

There are three different types of restrictions:

1. Restrict your subjects/motives
2. Restrict your gear
3. Use different gimmicks like prisms or filters

Currently, there are more than 300 different combinations of
restrictions - albeit of course some are not sensible. And,
sometimes, things don't change. That's because the lists now do not
have many things in them!

### Usage

By clicking on the "Get inspired" button, all three restrictions will be chosen randomly. If you toggle "Pause" in any field, this field will not be used the next time the button is pressed.

(Please note that responsive design has not yet been implemented, though it will be in the future.)
